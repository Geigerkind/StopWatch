**Hey,**  
a guild mate asked me if there is a stopwatch addon in vanilla, because this could be very useful sometimes. Actually after some research I discovered that there is not actually a proper stopwatch. Therefore I created a simple stopwatch that uses blizzards style.

**Commands:**  
/sw show
/sw hide
/sw scale (Number)

This addon is just a quick project and will be priorticed very low in terms of fixing. (If there are any bugs)  

cheers,
